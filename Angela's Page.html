                <h2 class="featurette-heading">Recently, I like to play golf.</h2>
                <p class="lead">Golf is a popular precision sport played on vast, lush courses. The objective is to complete a series of holes in as few strokes as possible. Players use a set of clubs to hit a small ball into a series of strategically placed holes on the course. Each hole has a starting point, known as a tee, and an ending point, the cup. Golf is known for its emphasis on etiquette, sportsmanship, and adherence to a set of rules. It can be played individually or in groups, with players taking turns to navigate the course. Beyond its competitive aspect, golf is enjoyed for its social aspects, outdoor setting, and the skill required to master various shots. It's a sport suitable for all ages and skill levels, offering both physical activity and a mental challenge.</p>

                <p class="lead">Stinky tofu, a popular Taiwanese street food, is a unique and aromatic delicacy that might challenge your senses but delights many adventurous eaters. Originating from China, this fermented tofu is recognized for its strong odor, a result of the fermentation process. Typically deep-fried or grilled, stinky tofu boasts a crispy exterior and a soft, flavorful interior. Its distinct smell comes from a fermentation method that can vary regionally. Despite its pungent aroma, the taste is surprisingly savory and complex. Often served with soy sauce, pickled vegetables, or spicy sauce, stinky tofu has a devoted following for its rich taste and cultural significance, making it a must-try for those seeking bold culinary experiences..</p>

                <p class="lead">In 1624, Dutch built the first fort in Anping, Taiwan, called "Fort Zeelandia", now known as Anping Old Fort, where has been the administrative center of the Dutch regime, and the hub for trading. The building was originally constructed in square inner fortress and rectangle outer walls. In 1661, the fort was renamed as Anping to commemorate his home town when Koxinga (Cheng Cheng Kung) has driven the Dutch out of Taiwan. Therefore, Fort Zeelandia was also known as "King's Fort" or "Taiwan Fort", nicknamed Anping Old Fort. In Kangxi Emperor's regime of Qing Dynasty, Taiwan was included in the empire that the political center was transferred to Tainan City, causing the decline of the Fort. The red bricks of the Fort have been taken for construction of Eternal Fortress. During the Japanese occupation, the Dutch style buildings in inner fortress were completely destroyed. A square red-bricked step platform was constructed with a western style house on the platform, being served as dormitory for Customs officials, where the memorial hall now is located. It was named Anping Old Fort after Restoration of Taiwan and become an attraction for tourists. The remaining more than 70 meters long south walls of the outer fort with worn-out red bricks, accompanied by the old banyan roots, chanted its odyssey. The fort is the very historical replica over three hundred years.
